# Simple Todo App

This app can create and delete to-do items. 

## Functionality

The to-do items each have a checkbox and a delete button. The form for creating a new to-do item has an optional deadline input. The "Submit" button in the form is disabled until the form validation is completed with a valid result. After a new to-do item is added, the form resets. 

## Technology

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We focused on refactoring some existing JavaScript code and implementing JavaScript classes. In addition to refactoring existing code, we also wrote code to create form reset functionality that is completed after form submission. 

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
